Recently, a friend of mine approached me regarding the automation of a task he was performing on a regular basis. Everyday when the market closed he would visit <a href='http://www.hl.co.uk/shares/stock-market-summary/ftse-100'>hl.co.uk</a>, copy the market summary data, manually sort and format said data and then include it in a blog post on his companies website. He was curious if this process could be automated somehow and how easy it would be to accomplish such a thing.

## Why node.js?

I like node.js and believe javascript as a language is relatively easy to learn, understand and teach. I wanted to demonstrate how easy it would be to automate such a task and hopefully encourage my friend to lean how to code.
